A turntable for norns 

After many years as a musician, I decided this year I wanted to DJ for the first time.I donâ€™t have turntables, but I do have a norns or two. So I made this.

The intention was to squeeze lots of the functionality of a single turntable onto norns. And the intention was also to resist making a full DJ app. To use this to mix, you will need more than one norns, and a mixer. Or maybe you have just one turntable, and you can mix between the two.

Because this uses softcut, softcut's limitations apply: wavs only, 48kHz recommended, max 5 minutes 49.52 seconds in length.

All gratitude and props to monome, the documentation writers, and the lines community for teaching me how to do this.
